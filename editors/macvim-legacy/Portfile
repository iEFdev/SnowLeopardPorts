description             MacVim is a GUI version of vim for Mac OS X
long_description \
                        MacVim is a port of the text editor Vim to Mac OS X that is meant to look \
                        better and integrate more seamlessly with the Mac than vim-app. As the \
                        current version of MacVim will not build or run on 10.6, this port installs \
                        the last working version of a pre-built binary.
